# AutonomousScreaming
This was an attempt at a car that would increase a counter for how long you screamed into the gas intake, and then would decrease that counter as the car moved forward autonomously.

The code seemed to work fine, but the execution on my arduino/rc car combo did not work out to well. I could not make it work well enough, to my standards, through the 3-4 complete re-designs of the rc car. It ran, but very poorly.
